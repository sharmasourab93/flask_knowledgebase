** Tech Stack ** : Python3 + Flask + MySQL 

Build a Flask Application, which takes *No UI* and Only has a *Backend* (make use of JSON for API).
The application should be able to do the following over HTTP Protocols \[ namely `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` ] : 

    1. Get all the Knowledge Items
    2. Get a Knowledge Item based on UID
    3. Get a Knowledge Item based on a Row Value
    4. Insert Values 
    5. Alter Values 
    6. Delete Values


The application needs to operate on a database like `mysql` or `postgres`. 

The application should implement `unittest`. 

The application should be delivered as a `Docker` container.
